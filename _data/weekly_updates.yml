- title: "Week 2"
  last_week:
    - Last week I came up with a few ideas that I'd like to learn more about and could be used for my project. After reading the feedback, I narrowed my idea down to learning more about C++. I'd like to dive deeper into some more advanced concepts while also solidifying my current knowledge. After some research online, it looks like learncpp.com is a great resource.
  this_week:
    - This week I plan on working through some chapters on learncpp.com. I plan on skimming over the first few because much of it is stuff I have already learned. I will try to do around 1 chapter per week give or take depending on the difficulty.
  impediments:
    - There are not really any impediments in my way. This seems like a manageable goal and is an interesting topic to keep my engaged.
  reflection:
    - I can set a daily goal of time spent learning. I plan on spending around 1 hour per day (up to 4 hours per week) working on learning this as well as maintaining my website and really getting my LinkedIn squared away.

- title: "Week 3"
  last_week:
    - I worked through a couple more chapters on learncpp.com as well a completed a couple leetcode problems using Python. I also got the basic layout of my personal website up and running.
  this_week:
    - I plan to continue working through the chapters. I am finishing up most of the chapters that will be review for me and then starting to work on some more advanced concepts.
  impediments:
    - There are not any current roadblocks. Most of the contents so far has been review from prior classes.
  reflection:
    - I need to make sure to stick to my plan and complete the hours stated. I plan to set a specific day/time that I can complete these tasks.

- title: "Week 4"
  last_week:
    - Submitted my project proposal
    - Worked on my website some more and got it mostly up and running
    - Worked through more of learncpp.com and started on some more advanced sections
  this_week:
    - Continue working through the chapters and doing some readings outside of the text
  impediments:
    - None at this time
  reflection:
    - All has been going smooth overall at this point, but just need to make sure I stay on track going forward.

- title: "Week 5"
  last_week:
    - I updated the weekly updates section of my website. I also continued to work through my chapters for my project. I am starting to think of some good ideas for a physical project to create with the new features I have learned in C++.
  this_week:
    - I'm starting to get into some more advanced concepts. This will slow down my pace, but I will continue to work my way through them.
  impediments:
    - There are not any current roadblocks.
  reflection:
    - I've been setting aside a specific day/time to work on my projects for each class. This schedule has helped me maintain accountability.

- title: "Week 6"
  last_week:
    - Continued working my way through chapters in my C++ course.
    - Came up with some project ideas that use embedded systems and C++:
    - Smart plant watering system that uses an arduino and sensors
    - DIY home weather station
  this_week:
    - Solidify my project and start working on getting the materials and begin working on the code.
  impediments:
    - I am still relatively new when it comes to electronics/robotics so creating the system will have a steep learning curve, but I am very interested in these so I am looking forward to it.
  reflection:
    - Begin to narrow down what actual concepts I will need for my project instead of trying to learn every single piece of C++ which would obviously take much longer than what we have available.
