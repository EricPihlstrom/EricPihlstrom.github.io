- title: "Week 2"
  last_week:
    - Last week I came up with a few ideas that I'd like to learn more about and could be used for my project. After reading the feedback, I narrowed my idea down to learning more about C++. I'd like to dive deeper into some more advanced concepts while also solidifying my current knowledge. After some research online, it looks like learncpp.com is a great resource.
  this_week:
    - This week I plan on working through some chapters on learncpp.com. I plan on skimming over the first few because much of it is stuff I have already learned. I will try to do around 1 chapter per week give or take depending on the difficulty.
  impediments:
    - There are not really any impediments in my way. This seems like a manageable goal and is an interesting topic to keep my engaged.
  reflection:
    - I can set a daily goal of time spent learning. I plan on spending around 1 hour per day (up to 4 hours per week) working on learning this as well as maintaining my website and really getting my LinkedIn squared away.

  last_week:
    - I worked through a couple more chapters on learncpp.com as well a completed a couple leetcode problems using Python. I also got the basic layout of my personal website up and running.
  this_week:
    - I plan to continue working through the chapters. I am finishing up most of the chapters that will be review for me and then starting to work on some more advanced concepts.
  impediments:
    - There are not any current roadblocks. Most of the contents so far has been review from prior classes.
  reflection:
    - I need to make sure to stick to my plan and complete the hours stated. I plan to set a specific day/time that I can complete these tasks.
