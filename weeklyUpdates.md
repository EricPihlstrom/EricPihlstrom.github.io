<h2>Week 1:</h2>
  <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Last week I came up with a few ideas that I'd like to learn more about and could be used for my project. After reading the feedback, I narrowed my idea down to learning more about C++. I'd like to dive deeper into some more advanced concepts while also solidifying my current knowledge. After some research online, it looks like learncpp.com is a great resource.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This week I plan on working through some chapters on learncpp.com. I plan on skimming over the first few because much of it is stuff I have already learned. I will try to do around 1 chapter per week give or take depending on the difficulty.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>There are not really any impediments in my way. This seems like a manageable goal and is an interesting topic to keep my engaged</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I can set a daily goal of time spent learning. I plan on spending around 1 hour per day (up to 4 hours per week) working on learning this as well as maintaining my website and really getting my LinkedIn squared away.</li>
  </ul>
